# zero-to-hero
Hi! I'm HASHIR SAYED, a B.Tech student at GGSIPU, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML).

This repository — zero-to-hero — is a personal project where I document my journey of mastering Python programming from the ground up. From writing my first print statement to building logic with real-world projects and solving algorithmic challenges, this is where it all unfolds.

My goal is to become a strong problem solver and developer — and this repo is my open notebook where I:

🐍 Learn and apply Python basics and advanced concepts

💡 Practice with coding problems and mini-projects

🧠 Explore data structures, algorithms, and Python libraries

☪️  Faith-driven, purpose-focused, and passionate about tech
